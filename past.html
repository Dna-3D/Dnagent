            <p>
                In the heart of the bustling city of Lagos, where ambition ran high and secrets were buried even deeper, lived a girl named Lulu. Her beauty was undeniable, her confidence unshakable, and her charm dangerously addictive. Wherever she went, heads turned. Women watched with caution, and men, most of all, forgot to remember they were taken.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lulu was not always this woman. There was a time she was calm and sweet, when her heart beat with innocence and love was not a weapon. But betrayal has a way of reshaping people. Her world collapsed the day another woman stole her husband, a man she cherished like a rare jewel. In that moment, something inside Lulu snapped.
            </p>

            <p>
                What began as heartbreak slowly evolved into a quiet thirst for revenge. Not loud. Not reckless. Calculated. She stopped believing in love and began believing in power. Her revenge was silent and subtle. She transformed into a woman who was beautiful, confident, and dangerously strategic.
            </p>

            <p>
                Her mission was clear: married men. Not for love. Not for money. But for satisfaction. She wanted women to feel what she once felt—helpless, betrayed, broken.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lulu never seduced openly. She mastered the slow burn: lingering eye contact, gentle touches, late-night conversations that felt harmless until they were not. Men came to her broken or bored, and she welcomed them with open arms, always knowing they would never stay. She never wanted them to.
            </p>

            <p>
                But for every wife who wept, for every child who watched their father pack a suitcase, the universe took note.
            </p>

            <p>
                Then came Eric.
            </p>

            <p>
                He was different. Older. Wiser. Grounded. He wore his wedding ring like it was part of his soul, and that intrigued Lulu. She did not plan to fall for him—but she did. Maybe it was how he listened to her as if she mattered. Maybe it was how he never rushed her. For the first time in years, she wanted more.
            </p>

            <p>
                What Lulu did not know was that Eric’s wife, Dabere, was a spiritual woman. Years earlier, she had lost her best friend to infidelity, her home destroyed by a woman just like Lulu. In her quiet pain, Dabere placed a curse:
            </p>

            <p><em>
                “Any woman who knowingly tears apart what I have built will eat the fruit of sorrow tenfold.”
            </em></p>

            <p>
                Silent. Spiritual. Brutal.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unaware, Lulu walked straight into the trap, following the same patterns that had never failed her. Eric responded. Their affair began.
            </p>

            <p>
                At first, everything felt normal. He adored her. Money flowed. Attention never lacked. Then things slowly changed. Strange coincidences. Health issues. Loss of control. Nightmares haunted her—women she had never met crying in corners, children pointing at her with blank eyes, mirrors reflecting wounds that were not there.
            </p>

            <p>
                Her glamorous life crumbled. Eric disappeared without a word. Friends abandoned her one by one. Her once-radiant body grew tired. Her phone stopped ringing.
            </p>

            <p>
                She sought help everywhere—pastors, spiritualists, therapists. None could help. Some told her plainly,
                <em>“You have bitten more than you can chew.”</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                One night, alone in her apartment, Lulu broke. She cried not tears of regret, but tears of understanding. She remembered the women she mocked, the children she never considered, the homes she helped destroy.
            </p>

            <p>
                She tried to make amends. Letters were written. Calls were made. Some cursed her. Some hung up. One woman simply said,
                <em>“Now you know.”</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                Years passed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lulu became quiet. Humble. She started a women’s healing group and never hid her past. She did not ask for pity. She only sought peace.
            </p>
