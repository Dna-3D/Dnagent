        <section class="post-content">

            <p>
                The two faint blue lines didn’t just confirm a pregnancy — they shattered my future.
                They sat there on the plastic test strip like a silent verdict, cold and final,
                telling me that the life I had carefully planned was no longer mine.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Campus life didn’t stop. Mine did.</strong></p>

            <p>
                It was a Tuesday afternoon at Akintola Hall. Outside, the usual 300-level chaos continued —
                students rushing to lectures, laughter echoing through corridors, a Davido song leaking
                from a nearby radio.
            </p>

            <p>
                Inside my room, the air was thick with antiseptic and fear.
                Ada sat on the edge of my bed, shoulders shaking silently.
                I stared at the test strip, my mind flooded with my father’s disappointment,
                my mother’s tears, and the imagined cry of a baby.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Ada was pregnant.</strong></p>

            <p>
                Before that day, my biggest fear was Dr. Okoro’s Advanced Calculus exam —
                the dreaded “Dragon of the Engineering Faculty.”
                Life was predictable: lectures, Indomie-fueled nights, weekend debates at the student bar.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ada was my constant. We met in a 100-level chemistry lab, partners by chance,
                lovers by choice. We planned everything — graduation, NYSC, Lagos, success.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Then one test strip ended all the plans.</strong></p>

            <p>
                Sleep became impossible. Not because of books, but because of questions.
                How would we tell our parents? My father, a stern pastor.
                Hers, a market woman who sacrificed everything for her daughter’s education.
            </p>

            <p>
                Abortion was a word we were too afraid to say out loud.
                My 4.0 CGPA suddenly felt useless.
                Lectures blurred into thoughts of hospital bills, diapers, and formula.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Nothing prepares you for fear like responsibility.</strong></p>

            <p>
                Our relationship cracked under pressure.
                Laughter turned into whispers.
                “What are we going to do?” Ada asked again and again.
                My only answer — “I don’t know” — sounded like abandonment.
            </p>

            <p>
                Campus gossip spread fast.
                Conversations stopped when I entered rooms.
                Some friends advised abortion. Others preached responsibility.
                Many simply disappeared.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ada suffered worse — the stares, the judgment, the quiet cruelty.
                We became isolated, stranded on separate islands of pain.
            </p>

            <p>
                My grades slipped. Tests failed.
                Deadlines missed.
                Nights spent holding Ada through panic attacks that left her shaking and breathless.
            </p>

            <p><strong>I was failing — as a student, a partner, and a man.</strong></p>

            <p>
                The future I planned dissolved into chaos.
                Success felt like a lie.
                Hope felt expensive.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was drowning — not in water, but in consequences.
                Responsibility wrapped around my neck quietly,
                until breathing felt optional.
            </p>

            <p>
                That Tuesday didn’t just change my semester.
                It changed who I was forced to become.
            </p>
